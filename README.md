## About The Project

The purpose of this program is to learn and demonstrate how threaded binary search trees are created, mapped, and traversed. The program is a console-driven application that displays the binary tree visually in the console output. The binary tree is constructed through nodes that are dynamically linked to one another. This dynamic linking creates a 'thread' throughout the tree that can be traversed by in-order or reverse-order.
